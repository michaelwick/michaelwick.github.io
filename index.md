Michael Wick is a senior member of the technical staff in the Machine Learning Research Group at Oracle Labs in Burlington MA.  His research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing with a proclivity for probabilistic modeling, a family of techniques, I've been told, now relegated to the study of the antiquarian.  Among other things, he's interested in studying ways of exploiting the natural structure in large quantities of unlabeled data, as well as exploring the limits of such approaches.  For a given task, what is the appropriate inductive bias that allows us to entertain and accept correct hypotheses from as little data as possible?

Prior to joining Oracle Labs he did his Ph.D. with [Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) at the University of Massachusetts.  There he focused on solving challenging information extraction and knowledge base construction problems that often required researching novel training and inference algorithms in order to first expand the scope of what problems could be efficiently addressed by the tool of choice at the time: discriminative undirected graphical models.  Many of the techniques developed for these problems, such as SampleRank training, countenanced the probabilistic programming toolkit [FACTORIE](http://factorie.cs.umass.edu), which allows a data scientist to specify nearly arbitrary conditional random fields while still supporting efficient learning and inference.  His dissertation *Epistemological Databases for Probabilistic Knowledge Base Construction* [[pdf]](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1338&context=dissertations_2) harnessed FACTORIE and made progress towards continual incremental KB construction via never-ending probabilistic inference.
